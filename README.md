# python-app-template

A simple Python app template configured with [`pdm`].

Several shortcuts have been set in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml):

- `pdm run main` to launch the app.
- `pdm run test` to launch tests.
- `pdm run fmt` to format all Python source files.

## Quick Start

Replace all occurrences of `bonjour` to your project name both in the files and file/folder names (eg. `./src/bonjour`).
